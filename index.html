		<h1>What is this?</h1>
		<p>This boring looking page is probably a crime against humanity... Yes, you read that correctly. It's heresy, it's disgusting and it probably guarantees me a free ticket to The Hague. Why? Well, it's not just any old, boring simulation of a shift register. No. This is an actual shift register that was written in Verilog. The very same Verilog you can turn into actual silicon hardware. This Verilog was then transpiled to C++ using Verilator. So far so good.</p>
		<p>However, this is where my heresy begins: I didn't compile that C++ with gcc or clang, instead I used emscripten! This Verilog code is now enslaved by Javascript using the dark magic of WebAssembly.
