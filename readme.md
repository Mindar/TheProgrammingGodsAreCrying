# What's in this repository?
Heresy.

## How did I create it?
I transpiled a Verilog shift register to C++ using Verilator. 
I then - against all that is holy - compiled the resulting C++ code to WebAssembly using emscripten.

The result is a verilog shift register that is running as a website.

So yes, I enslaved Verilog to run in the web.
